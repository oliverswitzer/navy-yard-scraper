# BK Navy Yard Scraper

Used to automatically create a WeWork and Navy Yard pass for myself at the Brooklyn :)

# Usage

### To run locally:

First ensure you've installed direnv according to the [top-level README.md](../README.md)

Then, to run either scraping script:

```
npm run navy-yard
npm run wework
```
